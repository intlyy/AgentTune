Considering the workload and database characteristics you've provided, along with the provided knob settings and corresponding performance metrics, we can make informed adjustments to the MySQL RDS instance configuration to potentially improve performance.

### Step 1: Analyze Current Configuration and Metrics
1. **Workload Characteristics**: 
   - High read-write ratio
   - High concurrency (32 threads)
2. **Current Bottleneck Observations**:
   - **Buffer Pool Utilization**: Substantial dirty pages (about 8% of total pool size) could be causing frequent flushes which impede throughput.
   - **Lock Metrics**: Minimal deadlocks and timeouts, indicating that lock management is not currently a bottleneck.
   - **I/O Metrics**: High OS data reads and writes, suggesting that disk I/O may be a limiting factor.

### Step 2: Adjust Knobs for Potential Improvement
1. **Buffer Pool**:
   - Increase `innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct` to reduce the flushing frequency, as high dirty pages aren't currently causing noticeable issues. This would reduce I/O overhead caused by flushing.
     ```json
     "innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct": 75
     ```
   
2. **Logging**:
   - Considering the high number of `os_log_bytes_written` and `log_write_requests`, increasing `innodb_log_file_size` may reduce the frequency of log flushes to disk.
     ```json
     "innodb_log_file_size": 2147483648  // Increase to 2GB
     ```

3. **Concurrency Control**:
   - Since the workload exhibits high concurrency and the system allows for up to 32 threads, it might be beneficial to utilize the full potential by setting `innodb_thread_concurrency` to 0 (unlimited), allowing MySQL to dynamically manage concurrency.
     ```json
     "innodb_thread_concurrency": 0
     ```

4. **I/O Capacity**:
   - Given the significant number of reads and writes, slightly increasing `innodb_io_capacity` might help better utilize the I/O subsystem, especially as `buffer_pool_reads` are high.
     ```json
     "innodb_io_capacity": 1300
     ```

### Step 3: Overall Configuration Recommendation

Here's the adjusted configuration based on our analysis:
```json
{
    "innodb_buffer_pool_size": 11811160064,
    "innodb_log_file_size": 2147483648,  // Increased to optimize log flush frequency
    "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit": 2,  // Good balance between performance and durability
    "innodb_io_capacity": 1300,  // Increased slightly to improve I/O utilization
    "innodb_flush_neighbors": 0,  // Good setting for HDD
    "innodb_thread_concurrency": 0,  // Dynamic management based on workload
    "innodb_read_io_threads": 8,  // Optimized for concurrent read-heavy operations
    "innodb_write_io_threads": 8,  // Optimized for concurrent write operations
    "innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct": 75  // Increased to reduce unnecessary flushing
}
```

### Step 4: Monitor and Iterate
After applying the recommended changes, closely monitor the key metrics, especially:
- Buffer pool usage and states (dirty, free, total)
- OS level I/O metrics
- Log metrics and potential waits

This iterative tuning approach will help adapt the configuration further based on real-world data.
