### Analysis of the Current Configuration and Performance Metrics

The given database system operates in an OLAP, read-only environment, processing a reasonably small dataset (1 GB) with significant resources in terms of CPU and memory. The performance is measured by the latency, which stands at approximately 15.44 units.

#### Key Observations from Current Metrics:
1. **Buffer Pool Utilization**:
   - A high number of buffer pool reads (`buffer_pool_reads: 492932`) compared to buffer pool read requests suggests frequent data fetching from the disk, which can be a bottleneck.
   - There are no waits for buffer pool free pages (`buffer_pool_wait_free`), indicating sufficient memory allocation under current load, but the high disk read rate needs addressing.

2. **Lock Metrics**:
   - There are no deadlocks or lock waits, which is excellent for system health.

3. **Query Performance and Disk Operations**:
   - The `os_data_reads` value is closely aligning with `buffer_pool_reads`, indicating most data operations are disk-bound.

4. **Logging and Durability**:
   - Minimal log writes and no log waits suggest that the current settings for the transaction log are adequate.

5. **Adaptive Flushing and I/O Capacity**:
   - Given the significant read operations from disk, further inspection into I/O capacity settings might be beneficial.

### Recommendations for Knob Adjustments to Optimize Latency

1. **Increase `innodb_buffer_pool_size`**:
   - Increasing the buffer pool size will allow more data to be cached in memory, reducing the need for disk reads.
   - Adjusting to the upper limit of available RAM configurations is advisable (within the `min` to `max` range provided). New value: `12G` (close to the max given system specs).

2. **Adjust `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max`**:
   - Increase `innodb_io_capacity` to around 800 to allow more I/O operations per second, which might help in faster data servicing.
   - `innodb_io_capacity_max` can be set to around 1800 to accommodate burst I/O operations during high-demand periods.

3. **Maintain `query_cache_size` at `0`**:
   - As the workload is OLAP, keeping query caching disabled (value at `0`) helps reduce overhead that doesn't benefit read-heavy workloads.

4. **Review and Adjust `innodb_log_file_size`**:
   - Ensure the log file size is adequate to handle transaction logging without needing frequent wraps. Given the low values for log writes, a moderate increase might ensure it captures more transaction data, proposed: `256M`.

5. **Optimize Disk Flushing Controls**:
   - Considering the disk type (HDD) and observed direct reads, set `innodb_flush_method` to `O_DIRECT` to improve efficiency of writes by avoiding double buffering.

6. **Reevaluation of Buffer Management**:
   - Increase `read_buffer_size`, `sort_buffer_size`, and `read_rnd_buffer_size` to higher within their allowed ranges to improve single-threaded read operations in sorting and scanning. Values around the upper range should be tested.

### Proposed Knob Configuration

```json
{
    "innodb_buffer_pool_size": 12884901888,  // Increased to max of allowable range
    "innodb_io_capacity": 800,  // Increased to help with disk I/O bottlenecks
    "innodb_io_capacity_max": 1800,
    "innodb_log_file_size": 268435456,  // Increased moderately
    "query_cache_size": 0,  // Maintained at 0, beneficial for OLAP
    "innodb_read_io_threads": 4,
    "innodb_write_io_threads": 4,
    "read_buffer_size": 2097152,  // Increased
    "innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit": 1,
    "innodb_flush_neighbors": 0,  // Changed to 0 for HDD optimization
    "sort_buffer_size": 4194304,  // Increased
    "read_rnd_buffer_size": 4194304,  // Increased
    "key_buffer_size": 8388608,
    "tmp_table_size": 16777216,
    "max_heap_table_size": 16777216,
    "innodb_thread_concurrency": 0,
    "table_open_cache": 4000,  // Increased to upper range
    "innodb_flush_method": "O_DIRECT",  // Set to O_DIRECT for HDD
    "innodb_change_buffer_max_size": 25
}
```

### Conclusion
These adjustments aim primarily at enhancing data residence in memory and refining disk I/O operations, which should collectively bring down the observed latency in query handling. Further monitoring would be essential to understand the impact of these changes and to make iterative improvements.
