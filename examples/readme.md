# Examples for Review #2 - Opportunity 2

This directory contains example outputs used to support our response to **Review #2 â€“ Opportunity 2**.

Specifically, it includes the LLM outputs from the configuration recommender phase for four representative workloads:

- `JOB.txt`  
- `SYSBENCH.txt`  
- `TPC-C.txt`  
- `TPC-DS.readme`

These examples demonstrate that the LLM bases its recommendations on the **provided context** rather than gussing **workload names** , as discussed in our response.
