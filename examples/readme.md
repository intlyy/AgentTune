# Example outputs

This directory contains example outputs used to support that LLMs do not attempt to infer or guess the underlying workload names.

Specifically, it includes the LLM outputs from the configuration recommender phase for four representative workloads:

- `JOB.txt`  
- `SYSBENCH.txt`  
- `TPC-C.txt`  
- `TPC-DS.txt`
